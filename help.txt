h1. rah_status_dropdown

p. Rah_status_dropdown is a visual admin-side extension for "Textpattern CMS":http://www.textpattern.com. The plugin changes _Write_ panel's _Status_ radio buttons into a select field. Changing the list of statuses into a select field will save extra space, and hides the extra article statuses that might have no real use to the writer.
